Hey guys,

We are a big TEAM! I hope you are enjoying our Udemy class and learning a lot! 

This is the place we will practice bug reporting. Please create as much as BUG you want. You can test any real website
(Amazon.com / NBA.com ...) or any Mobile Application and report bug here. If you can't find any, just report whatever
you want.

Let's practice more together and become a MASTER in Software Testing!
